Gameplay

Be the player with the highest score when the time runs out. Your score increases while you are holding the flag. You can use powerups to help you. Red powerups can only be grabbed when you aren't carrying the flag. The blue powerup is only for the flag carrier and it allows them to jump above the other player's shots. You cannot shoot while holding the flag. Being shot will make you drop the flag and will stun you for a brief period.

My game follows Quidditch rules and whoever is holding the flag when the time runs out gets a massive bonus instanly putting them in first place.
